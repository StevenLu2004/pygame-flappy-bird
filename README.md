# pygame-flappy-bird

PyGame implementation of Flappy Bird

## Notifications

This project is a practice assignment from a club in my highschool. As we are moving onto building a platformer, I'm not gonna work on this for a while. This won't get any better than Geometry Dash anyway.

## Install

Since I haven't packaged this project, you gotta have [Python 3](https://www.python.org) installed.

Make sure it's Python **3**. Version matters.

Then download or clone this repo to a local folder, `cd` to that directory, and

```shell
# Unix (OS X) | Linux
# Either
./launcher_unix_linux
# Or
python3 source/main.py

# Windows
# Either
python3 source\main.py
# Or
py -3 source\main.py
# Depending on the installation of Python 3 on your PC
```

If the dependency `pygame` is not installed, the program will attempt to install it and tell you if it succeeded. If not, follow [installation guidelines of PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

After PyGame is installed, relaunch the program.

## Controls

Space to flap.
